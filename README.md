# TypeScript Type Error: Adding Number and String

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript.  The `add` function is designed to add two numbers, but it's called with a number and a string. This will correctly result in a TypeScript compilation error.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.ts` shows how to correctly type the input to avoid the error.

This example highlights the importance of type checking in TypeScript to catch these kinds of errors at compile time, preventing unexpected runtime behavior.
